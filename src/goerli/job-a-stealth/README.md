# Job A Stealth

This is a slightly more complicated job than `JobA` as it uses a stealth mechanism to avoid frontrunning. For this reason, `JobAStealth`'s only purpose it's to add an extra job keepers can run to test their setup, and to see how to add upon `JobA`'s foundation to write a slightly complex job script.

## Config path
